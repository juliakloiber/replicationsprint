      <h3>THE FIRST REPLICATION SPRINT</h3>
      <p>The source project for our first replication sprint was Transparent Oil, a platform we developed with Namibian Matchbox partner the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), to help the group track how oil and gas exploration licences have been allocated among Namibian companies.</p>
      <p>The Transparent Oil platform had many reusable elements, like parts of the design, the underlying data model, the digitisation and data entry process, and some of the data scraping and data collection.</p>

          <h4>THE PARTNERS</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Partner organisations for the first replication sprint were the Citizens for Justice and Oxfam from Malawi (in cohort), and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA). Both groups were seeking help to ensure that natural resources in Malawi and Zimbabwe are managed in a transparent and accountable way, and they were looking for new ways to monitor that the industry is contributing to the national socio-economic development of their countries.</p>
          <p>
          The Engine Room’s first replication sprint happened in Cape Town this August, bringing together the two project teams, designers, developers, policy and data experts for a week of intense work.</p>

          <h4>THE EVENT</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Besides data cleaning and platform development, the replication sprint also included sessions around extractive industry transparency strategies.

          One of our goals was for our partners, Citizens for Justice, Oxfam, and ZELA, to be able to develop strong campaigning and advocacy strategies based on the data liberated, and we tried to explore the investigative potential of these new platforms.

          We looked at each organisation’s larger goals to identify the best ways to integrate tech and data planning into their core work, and together we tried to answer what type of data these groups should collect and how they can manage all the information. We even talked about ways to protect team members and prevent data loss.</P>

          <h4>THE RESULTS</h4>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>
          As a result of the sprint, we now have:

          two new structured databases for our partners in Malawi and Zimbabwe, that can serve as the foundation for future work to collect, organise and analyse additional information about extractive governance,
          a new set of liberated data on extractive industry licences and basic company information in these two countries, and a clear plan to collect more data on companies and their management structures,
          a refined set of documentation for the complex data models powering these platforms (to be published later), and most importantly, two organisations better equipped to lead reform, where the real impact happens.
