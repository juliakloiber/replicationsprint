      <p>In 2013, Code for America tackled a range of community problems by building technology solutions. Fellows gave South
      Bend residents a say about what
      happens to properties in the their neighborhood, and provided judges in Lousiville a better insight into population
      management in the justice system. Brigades made city budgets easier to understand and put real-time public transit
      info in the hands of riders. These open source applications are helping make government work better for everyone.</p>

      <h4>SCALING APPS AND IMPACT</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Fellowship apps were taken to new levels: version 2.0 of DiscoverBPS (built in 2011) is changing
      the way Bostonians select public schools, and in 2013 Detroiters used TextMyBus (2012) to look up more than
      a million bus arrival times. When Austin saw the worst flood season in 50 years, 
      people checked ATXfloods (2012) to stay safe.<br><br></p>

      <p>Brigades were a powerful force for spreading and scaling civic tech around the county &mdash; redeploying
      code written by Code for America and others, for their community's benefit. Civic startups took their
      products to new cities nationwide.</p>
