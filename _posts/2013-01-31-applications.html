      <h4>Day 1: Intros and getting started</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Intros and presentations. Explanation of the process. Open, creative, divergent brainstorming about the Sprint. Focusing on the tasks. Splitting the work into chunks (sprints). Defining shared features and custom features. Matching resources to chunks. Building teams. START.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Have a clear list of features we will be developing on top of the data model. Clear problem statements and draft user personas from both projects; prioritised functionalities for both projects.
      </p><br>
      <p> <strong>Documentation:</strong> During the sprint, the Documentation and Support role will make sure that all participants have easy-to-use and appropriate documentation platforms set up, and that each team is clearly communicating about their progress. This is particularly important when work on a project will pass between teams and roles.</p><br>

      <h4>Days 2: Workplan and Paper Prototypes</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Divergence - Mapping the data for existing features, what would aspirational features from day 1 look like, quick mock-ups<br><br></p>

      <p>Setting up github issues, assigning tasks for the platform dev</p><br>
      <p>Data preps, cleaning and data model </p><br>
      <p> Split the work into chunks (sprints); defining shared features and custom features; matching resources to chunks; building teams. Set-up regular quick slots for Days 3 and 4 when the dev group and product owners can check in. </p><br>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> clear work plan for the platform development. Refined data models for both projects. Updated understanding of what data is there. Paper prototypes. User flows and user personas.</p><br>

      <p>Documentation: Documentation of the Sprints is crucial to improve on the model, and to provide quality information for Product Owners and their orgs to maintain their work after the Sprint. After the sprint, the Core Team will take time to package the collected documentation so that it can be easily understood by non-participants. The documentation will be openly published.</p><br>
