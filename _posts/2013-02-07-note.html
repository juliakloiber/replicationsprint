        <p>Replication sprints are a part of The Engine Roomâ€™s Matchbox Program, designed to develop lasting partnerships with organizations who want to integrate data and technology in their social change projects.</p>

        <p>The idea is simple: we spend a week together with a few organizations who are facing the same challenges and interested in developing similar projects, and by the end of the week participants will walk away with components they can use right away. The end product will be complete in design and features, and developed around the specific needs of participants.</p>
