        <h4><p>Replication sprints are a part of The Engine Roomâ€™s Matchbox Program, designed to develop lasting partnerships with organizations who want to integrate data and technology in their social change projects.</p>

        <p>The idea is simple: we spend a week together with a few organizations who are facing the same challenges and interested in developing similar projects, and by the end of the week participants will walk away with components they can use right away. The end product will be complete in design and features, and developed around the specific needs of participants.</p>

        <p>"Replication sprints are one way of exploring how we can capitalize on the reusable nature of technology while adapting to deep variability of context and supporting partner organizations to develop enabling environments for data and technology in the future." (Alix Dunn)</p></h4>
